## Introduction

**This library is currently in *alpha*, neither the functionality nor
the API is stable**

This library provides geospatial multispectral image support for fastai.
FastAI already has extensive support for RGB images in the pipeline. I
try to achieve feature parity for multi-spectral images with this
library, specifically in the context of Sentinel 2 geospatial imaging.

It is inspired by these notebooks (and related works by the authors) \*
